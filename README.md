# Topic Modelling on Telugu-English Code-mixed data using LDA
Natural Language Processing Project
Topic modelling is the new revolution in text mining. It is a statistical technique for revealing the underlying semantic structure in large collection of documents. Most topic modelling/detection techniques applied well for English language but very little work is available when it comes to Indian languages and code mixed data. we used Latent Dirichlet Allocation(LDA) for detecting the hidden topics for the Telugu-English code mixed data and measured the accuracy of the topic modelling model using coherence score and evaluated using visualization and some testing dataset.
